1. Usage of ARIA Attributes
You have utilized ARIA attributes to improve screen reader compatibility:

In the LoginPage and RegisterForm components:

aria-labelledby is used to associate form titles (<h2>) with the form elements.
aria-label attributes for input fields like aria-label="Email" and aria-label="Password", which help screen readers identify the purpose of each input field.
In the DashboardPage component:

aria-labelledby and aria-describedby are used for the modal dialogs, providing detailed descriptions for screen readers.
2. Form Validation and Error Messages
In both LoginPage and RegisterForm:

You implemented error messages using the Alert component and set role="alert" for these messages.
role="alert" ensures that the screen reader immediately announces the error messages, providing instant feedback to the user.
3. Keyboard Accessibility
You considered keyboard navigation in some components:

You added functionality for submitting forms using the Enter key in both LoginPage and RegisterForm. This allows users to submit the form without needing to click the button, improving the experience for those who rely on keyboard navigation.
4. Descriptive Labels for Buttons and Interactive Elements
In many components, you used aria-label for buttons to provide clear descriptions:

Examples include aria-label="Submit login form" and aria-label="Create new presentation". These labels make it easier for screen reader users to understand the purpose of each button.
5. Semantic HTML and Structured Markup
You used semantic HTML elements such as <h2> for form titles in LoginPage and RegisterForm:

<h2 id="login-form">Login</h2> and <h2 id="register-form">Register</h2> provide clear section headings, helping screen readers navigate the content more effectively.
6. Visual Feedback and Interaction Cues
In MediaCard and DashboardPage:

You applied focus and hover styles, enhancing the experience for keyboard users by providing visual feedback when navigating through the interface.
Using Material-UI components like Button and Modal, which have built-in accessibility features, ensures better support for screen readers and keyboard interactions.
7. Responsive Design
While responsive design is not strictly part of accessibility, it significantly improves the user experience:

In MediaCard, you used flex-wrap and gap for layout adjustments, making sure the cards display well on smaller screens.
Dynamic font size adjustments using the clamp() function help maintain readability across different screen sizes.
